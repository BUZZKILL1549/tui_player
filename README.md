# TUI Music Player
A simple TUI music player made in rust with VIM bindings.

# INSTRUCTIONS
Once the app is built and run, press 'h'. This will take you to a help page which contains a cheatsheat of
all the commands you need.

# NOTE
Currently, the default music path is set to my own. Before running the app, you probably want to change that.
